         <h1>But first, what is social distancing?</h1> 
        <p class="social">Social distance is a term that has been used quite a lot in 2020 because of the pandemic of COVID-19. Social distance is a term that involves keeping your distance from others, the most normal is to keep at least 1-2-meter distance from others. Social distancing is a very important thing nowadays because you can catch the virus from being too close to someone and the either sneezing or spitting while talking. </p>

    <p class="according">ACCORDING TO REDD BARNA, school dropout is a continuous problem all over the world,especially in a country like Niger. Because of school shutdown due to COVID 19, many ofthese children will not return and the problem will only get bigger.FHI recommends social distancing as one of
    the best way to prevent the spread of COVID 19. <br><br>
    Based on the Principles for Digital Development and the research questions; “How can attendance and enrolment data prevent dropout in school?” and “How can technology play a role in solving the issue?” we have decided to focus our innovation on how to solve dropout as a direct consequence of the pandemic. NOvid will make social distancing effortless.</p>
